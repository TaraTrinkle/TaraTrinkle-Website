        <div class="subheading mb-5">High School Teacher's AidðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Tara Trinkle and I was born in New Orleans Louisiana. However, I am extremely lucky in that I have had the opportunity to travel immensely. I have traveled to over thirty-eight states and six countries. English is my primary language but I also possess adequate knowledge of the Spanish language and I am currently learning sign-language. All four years I attended my high school I participated in the bands color-guard along with the dance teamsâ€™ winter-guard. The last two years of I participate I held leadership positions as first Flag Captain and then later as Rifle Captain. I was also members of the reading and LGBTQ+ clubs on my campus. Every December I volunteered with the Toys for Tots foundation in order to make sure less fortunate children all over the world still got toys for Christmas. Later, I graduated from high-school in the top 6 percent and as secretary of the National Honors Society. Currently I am a 22-year-old, Liberal studies major at the University of California. I have taken a wide variety of classes including a multitude of Spanish, English literature, and education classes. I have also participated in a number of Teaching assistant work studies and shadowing programs. As a Teacherâ€™s Aid, I have had experience spanning from my junior year of high school in 2015 up until my last placement this year of 2020. My first position as a real TA was during my senior year of high school for a junior level chemistry class. During this time, I also volunteered as an Algebra tutor at our school tutoring center. My most recent opportunity was shadowing a local elementary teacher who participates in a duel-enrollment academic setting. This experience allowed me the opportunity to further develop my teaching practices for my EL (English language) Learners. It also allowed me to practice my Spanish with native speakers and work one-on-one with an experienced teacher to create real lesson plans. After I graduate in the spring of 2020 I plan to further my education and obtain a M.E.D (Masters of Education) specializing in Language disabilities. My ultimate goal is to work in a high-school as an English teacher or possibly as a reading and speech therapist. The reason I chose this career path is very personal for me. When I was growing up I had a speech impediment accompanied by less than adequate reading skills. If it was not for that one teacher who went above and beyond to help me, I would not be where I am today. She helped me develop my reading and speech skills. Furthermore, she instilled in me a love for reading and gave me the confidence I needed to speak clearly and publicly. I want to be that type of teacher for my future students. I hope to help them feel confident and develop the same passion for learning, specifically for reading, that I have developed because of her.
